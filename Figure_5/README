This folder contains all the results used for the plots of Figure 5 of the paper. It is organised as follows:

- The formfile.txt file contains the chemical (Hill) formula for each compound.
- Each molecule folder contain two folders, one for the aug-SZV-MOLOPT calculations and one for the aug-cc-pV5Z calculation. 
- Each aug-cc-pV5Z folder contains the CP2K input file (always named GW.inp) and the CP2K output file (cp2k.out).
- Each aug-SZV-MOLOPT folder contains 4 folders for the 4 RI error tolerances used for figure 5 (1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4 and 1e-5)
- Each RI tolerance subfolder contains 4 folders for the 4 RI Coulomb radial truncatures used for figure 5 (3.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0)
- Each cutoff subfolder contains the corresponding CP2K input file (always named GW.inp) and the CP2K output file (cp2k.out)
