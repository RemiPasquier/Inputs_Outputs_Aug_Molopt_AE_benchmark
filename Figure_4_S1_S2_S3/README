This folder contains all the results used for the plots of Figure 4 of the paper, along with figures S1-S2-S3 of the supporting information (SI). It is organised as follows:

- The two main folders contain the calculations for the molecules in the GW5000 (see sec VII of the paper) and GMTKN55 (see S1 of the SI) molecular subsets.
- The formfile.txt file contains the chemical (Hill) formula for each compound, the gemetry can be found in each CP2K input file.
- In both the GW5000 and GMTKN55 folders, one can find folders named after each molecule in their corresponding dataset.
- Each molecule folder contain subfolders named after the basis set used
- Each basis set folder contains two folders, one for the GW+BSE calculation and one for the TDDFT calculation.
- Each calculation folder contains the CP2K input file (always named GW.inp) and the CP2K output file (cp2k.out).
